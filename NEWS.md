# freesurfer 1.8.0.902

- Split single vignette into several smaller vignettes with more tutorial like sctructure and language.
  - Original vignette is saved as "paper.Rmd" and is ignored by R build.
- Add function `fs_sitrep()` whose intent is to check, verify and output information on Freesurfer-R communication for the user.
- Refactor of `get_fs()` as a result of `fs_sitrep()` and the need to consolidate how to check for Freesurfer system setup.
  - New `get_fs_*` functions underlie both the approaches and provide more fine grained control for each setting.
- Substitute `warning`, `stop`, `message` and `cat` with corresponding `cli` functions for more modern stdout and stderr output.
