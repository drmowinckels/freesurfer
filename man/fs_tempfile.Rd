\title{Create a Temporary File with a Newly Created Directory}
\usage{
fs_tempfile(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Arguments passed to the \code{\link{tempfile}} function, typically
used to customize the prefix, suffix, or pattern of the
temporary file name.}
}
\value{
A character string representing the full file path to the
temporary file. The directory containing the file will be
created if it does not already exist.
}
\description{
The \code{fs_tempfile} function generates a temporary file path and ensures
that the directory containing the file exists by creating it if necessary.
}
\details{
This function leverages \code{\link{tempfile}} to create a unique
file path within the system's temporary directory. Before
returning the file path, it ensures any required
directories are created using the \code{\link{dir.create}} function.
}
\examples{
# Create a temporary file and its directory
file_path <- fs_tempfile(pattern = "example_")

# Print the file path
print(file_path)

# Check if the directory exists
dir.exists(dirname(file_path))

}
