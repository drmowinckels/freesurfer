# freesurfer

The goal of freesurfer is a port/wrapper of
[Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) to R.

Much of the operations of Freesurfer are incorporated. This package is
very useful for structural imaging, such as MRI. Some of the fMRI
functionality has not been ported or has limited capability.

## Installation

You can install the released version of freesurfer from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("freesurfer")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("muschellij2/freesurfer")
```
