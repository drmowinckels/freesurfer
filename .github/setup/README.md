# Building a Complete Docker Image for FreeSurfer R Package Testing

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to build a complete Docker image for testing the FreeSurfer R package. 
The image comprises two Docker files that are built in stages, starting from a FreeSurfer base image and extending it to include R and supporting tools.

---

## Docker Files Structure
1. **Stage 1: FreeSurfer Base**
   - Defined in `Dockerfile-fs`.
   - Sets up FreeSurfer in an Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) environment.
2. **Stage 2: FreeSurfer + R**
   - Defined in `Dockerfile-r`.
   - Builds on top of the FreeSurfer base image, adding R and tools for R package testing.

## Building the Docker Image

### Step 1: Build FreeSurfer Base Image
The first stage involves building the FreeSurfer base image using `Dockerfile-fs`.

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile-fs -t freesurfer-base:8.0.0 .
```

### Step 2: Build FreeSurfer + R Image
The second stage extends the FreeSurfer base with R tools and libraries using `Dockerfile-r`.

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile-r -t freesurfer-r:fs_8.0.0-r_4.5.1 .
```

---

## Image Tagging Convention

- Format: `<language>-<framework>:<version>`
  - Example: `freesurfer-r:fs_8.0.0-r_4.5.1` where:
    - `r_4.5.1` is the R version.
    - `fs_8.0.0` indicates FreeSurfer version 8.0.0.

---

## Running the Image and Testing

Start the Docker container and run tests for the FreeSurfer R package.

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/workspace \
    freesurfer-r:fs_8.0.0-r_4.5.1 \
    bash -c "cd /workspace \
      && Rscript -e 'pak::local_install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)' \
      && Rscript -e 'devtools::check()'"
```

- `$(pwd)`: Mounts the current working directory to `/workspace` inside the container.
- Run two commands in the container:
  - Install dependencies with `pak`.
  - Perform an R CMD check with `devtools`.

## GitHub Actions CI Integration

### Workflow File
The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yml`) is designed to:
1. Test R packages across multiple OS configurations.
2. Use Docker to run FreeSurfer-specific tests.

### Key CI Steps
#### Non-Docker Builds
- Runs jobs on MacOS, Windows, and Ubuntu using specific R versions.

#### Docker-Based Checks
- Leverages FreeSurfer-specific Docker images:
  1. Pulls the appropriate `freesurfer-r` image.
  2. Executes R CMD check inside the container.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Docker Image Not Found**: Ensure the `freesurfer-base:8.0.0` and `freesurfer-r` images are built locally or available in the container registry.
  - Freesurfer is too large to be built in CI, so it must be built locally.
- **Package Not Found Errors**: Check the `Rscript` commands to ensure packages are being installed correctly.

---

This setup ensures a consistent and reproducible environment for developing and testing the FreeSurfer R package, supporting both local development and CI pipelines.
